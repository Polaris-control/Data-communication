1. Calculate the bandwidth of the light for the following wavelength ranges (assume a propagation speed of  m):
(a)1000 to 1200 nm
Solution:
c=λ⋅f
λ1 = 1000 nm
λ2 = 1200 nm
c (speed of light)  =  m
bandwidth = f1-f2 = c/λ1 - c/λ2 =5×10^13 hz








(b)1400 to 1600 nm
Solution:
c=λ⋅f
λ1 = 1400 nm
λ2 = 1600 nm
c (speed of light)  =  m
bandwidth = f1-f2 = c/λ1 - c/λ2 =1×10^14 hz




2. A path in a digital circuit-switched network has a data rate of 1 Mbps. The exchange of 1000 bits is required for the setup and teardown phases. The distance between two parties is 5000 km. Answer the following questions if the propagation speed is  m:
(a)What is the total delay if 1000 bits of data are exchanged during the data transfer phase?
Solution:
Data rate: 1 Mbps
Bits: 1000 bits
Distance: 5000 km
Propagation speed: 2×108 m/s
Total Delay Calculation
The total delay consists of three components:
Propagation Delay (Tp): Time for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver.
Transmission Delay (Tt): Time to push all the bits onto the wire.
Processing/Setup Delay (Ts): Time for setup and teardown.
Tp = Distance/Propagation speed = 0.025s
Tt =  Bits / Data rate = 0.001s
Ts = 2*Tt = 0.002s
Ttotal = 2Tp +2Tt + Ts = 0.054 s





(b)What is the total delay if 100,000 bits of data are exchanged during the data transfer phase?
Solution:
Tt =  Bits / Data rate = 0.1s
Ttotal = 2Tp +2Tt + Ts = 0.252 s






(c)What is the total delay if 1,000,000 bits of data are exchanged during the data transfer phase?
Solution:
Tt =  Bits / Data rate = 1s
Ttotal = 2Tp +2Tt + Ts = 2.052 s





(d)Find the delay per 1000 bits of data for each of the above cases and compare them. What can you infer from the result?
Solution:
For each case, let's find the delay per 1000 bits.

Case (a):
Delay per 1000 bits = 0.054s/1 = 0.054s
	
Case (b):
Delay per 1000 bits = 0.054s/100 = 0.00252s

Case (c):
Delay per 1000 bits = 0.054s/1000 = 0.002052s


3. We need a three-stage space-division switch with . We use 10 crossbars at the first and third stages and 4 crossbars at the middle stage.
(a)Draw the configuration diagram.
Solution:
Given data:

N= 100
n=10
k=4
In the first stage we have N/n=100/10-10 crossbars, each of size is 10×4. 
In the second stage, we have 4 cross bars, each of size is 10x 10. 
In the third stage, we have 10 cross bars, each of size is 4×10.










(b)Calculate the total number of crosspoints.
Solution:
Crosspoints are where connections cross within the switch. Calculate by multiplying the number of crossbars in adjacent stages: 10×4 for stages one to two, and 4×10 for stages two to three. Multiply by 10 (the number of crossbars in stage one) for total crosspoints: 10×4×10+4×10×10=1200



(c)Find the possible number of simultaneous connections.
Solution:
Since there are 4 crossbars in the middle stage and each can handle one   connection at a time, the maximum number of simultaneous connections is 4.



(d)Find the possible number of simultaneous connections if we use a single crossbar ().
Solution:
If a single crossbar of 100×100 is used, it could potentially handle 100 simultaneous connections, one for each input/output pair.



(e)Find the blocking factor, the ratio of the number of connections in part (c) and in part (d).
Solution:
The blocking factor is calculated by taking the number of possible connections in the non-blocking scenario (d) and dividing it by the number in the blocking scenario (c). Therefore, the blocking factor is 100/4=25.
