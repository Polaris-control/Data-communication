1. Calculate the bandwidth of the light for the following wavelength ranges (assume a propagation speed of  m):
(a)1000 to 1200 nm








(b)1400 to 1600 nm



2. A path in a digital circuit-switched network has a data rate of 1 Mbps. The exchange of 1000 bits is required for the setup and teardown phases. The distance between two parties is 5000 km. Answer the following questions if the propagation speed is  m:
(a)What is the total delay if 1000 bits of data are exchanged during the data transfer phase?





(b)What is the total delay if 100,000 bits of data are exchanged during the data transfer phase?





(c)What is the total delay if 1,000,000 bits of data are exchanged during the data transfer phase?





(d)Find the delay per 1000 bits of data for each of the above cases and compare them. What can you infer from the result?





3. We need a three-stage space-division switch with . We use 10 crossbars at the first and third stages and 4 crossbars at the middle stage.
(a)Draw the configuration diagram.










(b)Calculate the total number of crosspoints.




(c)Find the possible number of simultaneous connections.




(d)Find the possible number of simultaneous connections if we use a single crossbar ().




(e)Find the blocking factor, the ratio of the number of connections in part (c) and in part (d).
