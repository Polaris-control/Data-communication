1. Calculate the bandwidth of the light for the following wavelength ranges (assume a propagation speed of  m):
(a)1000 to 1200 nm
Solution:
c=λ⋅f
λ1 = 1000 nm
λ2 = 1200 nm
c (speed of light)  =  m
bandwidth = f1-f2 = c/λ1 - c/λ2 =5×10^13 hz








(b)1400 to 1600 nm
Solution:
c=λ⋅f
λ1 = 1400 nm
λ2 = 1600 nm
c (speed of light)  =  m
bandwidth = f1-f2 = c/λ1 - c/λ2 =1×10^14 hz




2. A path in a digital circuit-switched network has a data rate of 1 Mbps. The exchange of 1000 bits is required for the setup and teardown phases. The distance between two parties is 5000 km. Answer the following questions if the propagation speed is  m:
(a)What is the total delay if 1000 bits of data are exchanged during the data transfer phase?
Solution:
Data rate: 1 Mbps
Bits: 1000 bits
Distance: 5000 km
Propagation speed: 2×108 m/s
Total Delay Calculation
The total delay consists of three components:
Propagation Delay (Tp): Time for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver.
Transmission Delay (Tt): Time to push all the bits onto the wire.
Processing/Setup Delay (Ts): Time for setup and teardown.
Tp = Distance/Propagation speed = 0.025s
Tt =  Bits / Data rate = 0.001s
Ts = 2*Tt = 0.002s
Ttotal = 2Tp +2Tt + Ts = 0.054 s





(b)What is the total delay if 100,000 bits of data are exchanged during the data transfer phase?
Solution:
Tt =  Bits / Data rate = 0.1s
Ttotal = 2Tp +2Tt + Ts = 0.252 s






(c)What is the total delay if 1,000,000 bits of data are exchanged during the data transfer phase?
Solution:
Tt =  Bits / Data rate = 1s
Ttotal = 2Tp +2Tt + Ts = 2.052 s





(d)Find the delay per 1000 bits of data for each of the above cases and compare them. What can you infer from the result?
Solution:
For each case, let's find the delay per 1000 bits.

Case (a):
Delay per 1000 bits = 0.054s/1 = 0.054s
	
Case (b):
Delay per 1000 bits = 0.054s/100 = 0.00252s

Case (c):
Delay per 1000 bits = 0.054s/1000 = 0.002052s


3. We need a three-stage space-division switch with . We use 10 crossbars at the first and third stages and 4 crossbars at the middle stage.
(a)Draw the configuration diagram.










(b)Calculate the total number of crosspoints.




(c)Find the possible number of simultaneous connections.




(d)Find the possible number of simultaneous connections if we use a single crossbar ().




(e)Find the blocking factor, the ratio of the number of connections in part (c) and in part (d).
